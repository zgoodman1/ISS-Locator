# ISS-Locator
A basic Python application which uses web services to plot the location of the ISS
on a map of the planet as well as predict when the ISS will be over a particular 
location. This application is a project done to expand my working skills with 
Python and to develop my understanding of how Python can be used to interact with
JSON data, the uses of the urllib.request library and the turtle graphics library.
